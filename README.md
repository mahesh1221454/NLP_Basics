# **Getting Started with NLP: A Beginner's Workflow**

Welcome to the **Natural Language Processing (NLP) Guide**, a step-by-step guide designed to help beginners understand and implement NLP projects. This repository outlines the key concepts, techniques, and tools for solving real-world NLP problems.

---

## **Overview of NLP**
Natural Language Processing (NLP) enables machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language. It combines computational linguistics, machine learning, and deep learning to process text or speech data. Applications include:
- Sentiment analysis
- Chatbots
- Machine translation
- Text summarization
- Voice assistants

---

## **Workflow**
Follow these steps to build and deploy an NLP project:

### **1. Problem Definition**
- Define the objective (e.g., sentiment analysis, text classification).
- Determine the scope, challenges, and success metrics.
- Identify required data (e.g., labeled datasets, multilingual corpora).

---

### **2. Data Collection & Acquisition**
- **Sources**: Public datasets (Kaggle, Hugging Face), APIs (Twitter, Reddit), internal company data.
- **Cleaning**: Normalize text, remove duplicates, and handle encoding issues.

---

### **3. Text Preprocessing**
- Sentence Tokenization: Break text into sentences.
- Word Tokenization: Split sentences into words.
- Stopword Removal: Eliminate non-informative words.
- Stemming/Lemmatization: Reduce words to their base form.
- POS Tagging: Assign grammatical tags (e.g., noun, verb).
- Named Entity Recognition (NER): Extract entities like names, locations, dates.

---

### **4. Feature Engineering**
Convert text into numerical representations using:
- **Bag-of-Words (BoW)**
- **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**
- **Word Embeddings**: Word2Vec, GloVe

---

### **5. Model Building**
- Train models such as Logistic Regression, SVM, or neural networks (e.g., Transformers like BERT, GPT).
- Use libraries like Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Hugging Face Transformers.

---

### **6. Evaluation**
Evaluate the model using metrics:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score

---

### **7. Deployment**
- Deploy the model in production using frameworks like Flask or FastAPI.
- Example: Use a REST API to serve predictions.

---

### **8. Monitoring & Updates**
- Track performance using tools like Prometheus or Grafana.
- Detect data drift and retrain the model with updated data.

---

## **Key Tools and Libraries**
- **Preprocessing**: NLTK, spaCy
- **Modeling**: Hugging Face Transformers, TensorFlow, PyTorch
- **Feature Engineering**: Scikit-learn, Gensim
- **Deployment**: Flask, FastAPI
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, wordcloud

## NOTE:
I have completed the first 6 steps as per my requirements. For your reference, I have attached the steps I did not work on after that.
Happy coding and exploring NLP! ðŸš€
